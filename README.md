## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the [XMiDT Code Of Conduct](https://xmidt.io/code_of_conduct/). 
By participating, you agree to this Code.

## Details
Caduceator's function is to send and recieve events from Caduceus and calculate how long it has been cutoff as a consumer of Caduceus.

Caduceator has two endpoints: 1) receiving events, and 2) receiving cutoffs.

### Receiving Events - `/events` endpoint
The events endpoint will be able to recieve events from Caduceus after registering a webhook to Caduceus' `/hook` endpoint. Caduceator will then give a response back to Caduceus based on reading the body of the request.

### Receiving Cutoffs - '/cutoff` endpoint
The cutoff endpoint is hit in Caduceator when Caduceus cutsoff its consumers due to its queue being full. Once the cutoff endpoint is reached, a timer will start and continue until Caduceus empties its queue and is able to send events again to its consumers. The total time it takes to empty is queue is then recorded and saved as a metric.


## Build

### Source

In order to build from the source, you need a working Go environment with 
version 1.13 or greater. Find more information on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

You can directly use `go get` to put the Caduceator binary into your `GOPATH`:
```bash
go get github.com/xmidt-org/caduceator
```

You can also clone the repository yourself and build using make:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/xmidt-org
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/xmidt-org
git clone git@github.com:xmidt-org/caduceator.git
cd caduceator
make build
```

### Makefile

The Makefile has the following options you may find helpful:
* `make build`: builds the Caduceator binary
* `make docker`: builds a docker image for Caduceator, making sure to get all 
   dependencies
* `make local-docker`: builds a docker image for Caduceator with the assumption
   that the dependencies can be found already
* `make it`: runs `make docker`, then deploys Caduceator and a cockroachdb 
   database into docker.
* `make test`: runs unit tests with coverage for Caduceator
* `make clean`: deletes previously-built binaries and object files

### RPM

First have a local clone of the source and go into the root directory of the 
repository.  Then use rpkg to build the rpm:
```bash
rpkg srpm --spec <repo location>/<spec file location in repo>
rpkg -C <repo location>/.config/rpkg.conf sources --outdir <repo location>'
```

### Docker

The docker image can be built either with the Makefile or by running a docker 
command.  Either option requires first getting the source code.

See [Makefile](#Makefile) on specifics of how to build the image that way.

For running a command, either you can run `docker build` after getting all 
dependencies, or make the command fetch the dependencies.  If you don't want to 
get the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t caduceator:local -f deploy/Dockerfile .
```
If you want to get the dependencies then build, run the following commands:
```bash
GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor
docker build -t caduceator:local -f deploy/Dockerfile.local .
```

For either command, if you want the tag to be a version instead of `local`, 
then replace `local` in the `docker build` command.

### Kubernetes

WIP. TODO: add info

## Deploy

For deploying on Docker or in Kubernetes, refer to the [deploy README](https://github.com/xmidt-org/codex-deploy/tree/main/deploy/README.md).

For running locally, ensure you have the binary [built](#Source). If the binary 
is in your current folder, run:
```
./caduceator
```
